# Pima Indians Diabetes – Deep Learning Classification

This project implements a deep learning model using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to predict the presence of diabetes based on diagnostic health data.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains medical diagnostic measurements of Pima Indian women, including:
- Glucose, BMI, Age, Insulin, Blood Pressure, etc.

## 🔍 Objective
To develop a binary classification model using a neural network built in TensorFlow/Keras to predict diabetes risk.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of training history and metrics
